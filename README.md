# shellphone
Imagine some kind of credit card sized smartphone - many (modular) interfaces, very fast and nearly infinite battery service life.
It runs a small (uClibc) busybox linux - very hardware independent. Software is provided only by shell scripts using the tiny Almqvist shell (ash) - very software independent.
This side provides shell scripts to manage this operating system.

For easy operating of this small gadget only six (!) keys are necessary (similar to a small remote control):

 UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, OK and KO.

Of course for purposes of programming a keyboard connection or ssh-input is possible.
