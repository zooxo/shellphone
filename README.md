# shellphone

Imagine some kind of credit card (or wrist watch) sized smartphone
with many (modular) interfaces, very fast and nearly infinite
battery service life.

It runs a small (uClibc) busybox linux - very hardware independent.

Software is provided only by shell scripts using the tiny
Almqvist shell (ash) - very software independent.

This side provides shell scripts to manage this operating system.
Please help to improve these scripts.

For easy operating of this small gadget only six (!) keys are
necessary (similar to a small remote control or
a small touch screen):

 UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, OK and KO.

Of course for purposes of programming a keyboard connection or
ssh-input is possible.
