# shellphone
Imagine some kind of credit card sized smartphone - many (modular) interfaces and very fast with nearly infinite battery service life.
It runs a small (uClibc) busybox linux - very hardware independent. Software is provided only by shell scripts using the tiny Almqvist shell (ash) - very software independent.
This side provides shell scripts to manage this operating system.
